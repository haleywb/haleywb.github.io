			 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haley, a native of Colorado, will be receiving her BA in Studio Art and minor in Technology, 
			 Arts, and Media in May of 2016. Afterwards, she hopes to become a full-time, free-lance
			 commissioned artist. <br>
			 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her practice, she has attempted to stay both versatile and open-minded; she 
			 has experience with everything from the Adobe Suite to guitar building. Haley specializes 
			 in graphic design, including (but not limited to) logo and icon design, typography, and 
			 advertisement through fliers or posters. <br>
			 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite her digital preference, her roots are 
			 in traditional drawing and painting, which translate into tattoo design, greeting cards,
			 large scale murals, jewelry-making, woodworking, and more. 
			 Because of her wide range of skills, and her passion for the arts, she will remain open-minded
			 to all requests and will always prioritize <br> the
			 client. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div id="highlight">For any questions about commissions,<br> <a href="contact.html" 
			 ">contact</a>Haley directly. </div></div>
